# More about IPv6

Some tips, tricks, and configuraitons

## NMState configuration for IPv6

```yaml
ipv6:
  enabled: true
  autoconf: true
  dhcp: true
  auto-dns: false
  auto-gateway: true
  auto-routes: true
```

* autoconf means, that the IPv6 will be assigned based on received RA. [How SLAAC is calculated](https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2154680)

* dhcp means that the IPv6 will be assigned by a DHCP server

NetworkManager seems to have a bug that avoids to set 'autoconf: true' and 'dhcp: false'. More [here](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RFE-3671)
